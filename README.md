File Intercepter
------------------------

    A tool to download a different file  in place of desired file over http server. For example if a person 
    wants to download a file from a http server, then we can easily change the file with anything you want 
    to change with like a backdoor, keylogger, malware or any other thing.
    We can also redirect it to location of another site's download location(could be https).
    ** Work over http server only
